identical_point:
  inputs:
    - A, B: Point
  where:
    - equal: A == B
    - zero_distance: distance(A, B) == 0
  where_embedding:
    - A != B
  possible_conclusions:
    - equal <=> zero_distance
  rank: 3

uniqueness_of_collinear_double_distance:
  inputs:
    - A, B, C, D: Point
  where:
    - collinear(A, B, C)
    - distance(A, C) == distance(A, D)
    - distance(B, C) == distance(B, D)
  where_embedding:
    - distinct(A, B, C, D)
  conclude:
    - C == D
